> The Arctic This Week - News platform on the Android/iOS.

### Purpose of project

The Arctic Institute, Washington D.C., needed a convenient way to reach out to current and new subscribers with content relevant to them.

5 key news items would be published on a weekly basis by a team of researchers.

### Objective

The application had to be accessible and available to as many users as possible with minimal cost to the institute.

### Approach

The initial approach was to pull content from the institute's Wordpress CMS.

There were issues serving data to the iOS version; Wordpress was replaced with the headless Cockpit CMS which could host content without issues.

### Project duration

The project took a year to complete and with regular maintenance releases.

### Role

Lead developer
